            I would like to conclude by sharing that our students have unimaginative ideas, only they need to be directed rightly.  Let us support them and give them time to reflect and search themselves.

            “Children are given to us” -- on loan for a very short period of time. They come to us like packets of seeds,  with no pictures on the cover and no guarantees . We do not know what they will look like, act like or have the potential to become in future.
